### Project description: 
The main mechanic which is used to navigate the game is going to be clicking from cover to cover.
There will be a weather implemented using a REST API.
The weather is also going to influence the playing field.
For example heavy wind will make your aiming unstable.
You will also be able to refill your ammunition using pickups.
